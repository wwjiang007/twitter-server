Unreleased
----------

18.3.0
-------

No Changes

18.2.0
-------

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * Removed 'finagle-zipkin-core' as a depdendency since there was no
    code in twitter-server which used it. ``PHAB_ID=D129515``

18.1.0
-------

No Changes

17.12.0
-------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

  * Treat `io.netty.channel.epoll.Native.epollWait0` as an idle thread on
    "/admin/threads". This method is observed when using Netty 4's native
    transport. ``PHAB_ID=D115058``

17.11.0
-------

Breaking API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * Change to apply JUL log format in the `c.t.server.logging.Logging` trait
    constructor instead of in `premain` to apply format as early in the logging
    stack as possible. However, this means that users overriding the
    `def defaultFormatter` will not be able to use any flags to configure their
    formatting, note: the default `LogFormatter` does not use flags.
    ``PHAB_ID=D106534``

    details made it difficult to report reliably.

------

   finagle-http through twitter-server will need to switch to finagle-httpx.

1.10.0
------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * TwitterServer collects a statically allocated ring of runtime events, which be viewed
    at /admin/events, and downloaded as JSON with a HTTP client like curl (or by simply
    omitting the User-Agent header in the request).

  * TwitterServer exports runtime configuration data about your service, which can be
    downloaded as json at /admin/registry.json.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * Bumped many dependency versions.

1.9.0
-----

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * Most noticeably, the admin server received a complete UI redesign. All http endpoints are
    now available via a navigation pane. We provide a simple API for service owners to include
    ad-hoc admin pages which will be part of the navigation pane. Note, it is still possible to
    join the admin serverâ€™s namespace via the global com.twitter.finagle.http.HttpMuxer.

  * When using the twitter Metrics library, the admin server now scrapes your stats to
    extract a quick summary of how your server is performing. This includes secondly
    success rates for your server and least performant downstreams. We provide a /admin/metrics
    endpoint which can watch stats (at secondly granularity) and extract them via http queries.

  * More recently, Finagle clients and servers began to retain information about their composition.
    This is useful in examining the modules and parameters that comprise a specific implementation.
    We now surface this information in the admin server via /admin/clients/<client_name> and
    /admin/servers/<server_name>

  * TwitterServer now exposes a /admin/registry.json endpoint, which speaks json and exposes the
    values from util-registry as labels. Most labels are long-lived, and tend to represent something
    about a process that is true for the entire lifetime, like the version of a library, or what a
    flag was set to.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * Remove dependency on mustache for admin server in favor of templating
    via string interpolation. This is more hygienic for web applications
    and frameworks built atop twitter-server.

1.8.0
-----

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * Add the ability to promote objects to old gen before serving
  * Export everything from build.properties at /admin/server_info

Runtime Behavior Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * Add merge_base merge_base_commit_date and scm_repository to server_info
  * AdminHttpServer now disables tracing
  * Export gauge on eden allocations
  * Improve heuristic for returning html or not in WebHandler
  * Initial redesign of admin pages

Breaking API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * Remove ServerInfo class: export /admin/server_info directly from build.properties file
